# hexxagon-game-system
Hexxagon Game system for testing game agents.
---
Better start running with server, then agents, then visualizer.

ConstantsLibrary references need to be updated.
---
-ConstantsLibrary

Library with shared constants. Using C#.

-HexxagonEnvironment

Game environment. Console Application. Using C#, TCPClient.

-HexxagonVisualizer

Application for visualization. Using C#, WPF.

-Agent_Csharp

Empty C# agent. Can be used as a template.

-Agent_Raph v1.0

Agent. I can't guarantee that it's working.

Issues:

No agent+player and statistic only type.

Many exception when you turn clients/via/server on and of in a wrong order.
